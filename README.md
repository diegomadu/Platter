This project is based on the **Shopify Dawn theme** and demonstrates a custom **Best Sellers** feature.  
A new **Section** was created where the store owner can select a **Collection**, and all products from that collection will be displayed in a responsive **product grid**.

Each product is rendered inside a **card** that includes:
- The **main image**.
- The **second image** (if available), displayed on hover.
- The **current price** and **compare-at price** (if a discount is applied).
- A fully responsive layout optimized for mobile and desktop.
